    "\n",
    "The investigation into the relationship between the number of votes (`numVotes`)  \n",
    "and the average IMDb rating (`averageRating`) yields an interesting result:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The calculated **correlation of 0.011** is close to zero → there is **no meaningful linear relationship** between the two variables.\n",
    "- Despite the extremely low **p-value (< 0.00001)** indicating statistical significance, the result is **not practically relevant**.\n",
    "- The significance is most likely due to the **large sample size**, not the strength of the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The average rating of a movie on IMDb is **not dependent** on how many votes it has received.  \n",
    "Both widely known and lesser-known films tend to receive similar average ratings.  \n",
    "This challenges the common assumption that popular films are automatically rated higher – at least in a linear sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further analysis, it may be worth exploring **nonlinear relationships**, **outlier behavior**, or **genre-specific correlations**.\n"
